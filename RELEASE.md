Maintenance Release 1.3
=======================

This is the third release of the xde-styles package that provides a set
of styles for the XDE (_X Desktop Environment_) which provides a small
and consistent set of window manager styles across a wide range of
light-weight window managers.  The purpose is to provide a consistent
visual appearance for the _X Desktop Environment_ across all supported
window managers.

This release is a maintenance release whose only purpose is to update
the build system, generate better NEWS files, handle annotated tags, and
converts the release archives to lzip compression.

Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
from source.  See the [NEWS](NEWS) and [TODO](TODO) file in the release
for more information.  Please report problems to the issues list on
github.  [GitHub](https://github.com/bbidulock/xde-styles/issues).
