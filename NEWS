1.3             Maintenance Release 1.3

    This is the third release of the xde-styles package that provides a set
    of styles for the XDE (X Desktop Environment) which provides a small
    and consistent set of window manager styles across a wide range of
    light-weight window managers. The purpose is to provide a consistent
    visual appearance for the X Desktop Environment across all supported
    window managers.

    This release is a maintenance release whose only purpose is to update
    the build system, generate better NEWS files, handle annotated tags,
    and converts the release archives to lzip compression.

    Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
    from source. See the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more
    information. Please report problems to the issues list on github.
